# Alexa Crelate Integration

A hello world into using the Crelate Public API as an Alexa skill. 

Currently you can (with some hardcoded-ness): 

* Create a note on a job
* Read off the details about a list
* Return the number of applicants for a particular job
* Read the most 3 most recent notes on a job
